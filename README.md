# FastDelivery

This project is a small front-end development based on a mockup.

This project was developed in React, I used 'Create-react-app', I imported some free-use libraries in order to stylize the app's design (FontAwesome, Reactstrap, etc.) and I also used some of the fundamental concepts of React (State and Props)
